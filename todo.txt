-----Core mechanics------

- Pathfinding (KIRSTIE)
I'm not sure if Dijkstra or A* would be best as 'A* will usually prefer diagonal moves over orthogonal, while Dijkstra will have the opposite preference', maybe different types of monsters could use different ones to give them a more interesting movement pattern? (for our game, Robots could use Dij whilst thugs could use A*?)

~Shops/buying and selling (bim)
Way too simplistic though!

-A coloured line from the player to the mouse to show where you are aiming/clicking. (Kirstie)
This needs to eventually be evolved into projectiles following the line, so we can put things like cover in.

DONE Enemies following you out of LOS (Kirstie)
At the moment, if you escape their line of sight they just stop, which is sort of rubbish. One easyish way to do it would be via smell, which is the usual way RLs do it. There is a tutorial for it using C++ which shouldn't be toooo hard to convert:
http://codeumbra.eu/complete-roguelike-tutorial-using-c-and-libtcod-extra-3-scent-tracking

-Slightly more random damage and perception (Kirstie)
Damage is just a random extra +0 to +3, but needs to be more MATHEMATICAL (just like you like!). As in, it needs to be something related to the relative strength of the creature (for instance, a thug might only do between +0 and +2, whereas a Mutant might do +0 to +5).
Tohit (your actual perception) is this forumla:
((self.dexterityterity/2)+ self.perception)) - (randomly 0-3)
Actually hitting a target requires you to have a higher tohit than the targets dexterity. This again needs to be a bit more relative rather than just a straight minus 0-3. Unsure of formular to use, as we don't want it too tricksy.

-Enemy shooting
Enemies can shoot if they get given ammo and the 'BasicShooter' ai and then close into range once they've used it all - this wasn't given to all enemies, as at some point we might want shooters to have different sorts of AI

- Enemy special attacks (Bim)
All enemies have a 'charge' stat which can be used to give them access to spells/attacks. I've not implemented this but it's quite easy.

-Terrain based penalties (Bim)
I thought this might be interesting - so for example 'swampy ground' could have a negative defense property which lowers the players/monsters defence, whilst raised ground would give a bonus to shooting and so on. Don't think it's that needed at the moment.
